/*
Imagine you are responsible for a portfolio of profitable stocks represented in an array. Each item in the array represents
the yearly profit of a corresponding stock. The analyst gathers all distinct pairs of stocks that reached the target profit.
Distinct pairs are pairs that differ in at least one element. Given the array of profits, find the number of distinct pairs
of stocks where the sum of each pairâ€™s profits is exactly equal to the target sum.
Example:
stocksProfit = [5, 7, 9, 13, 11, 6, 6, 3, 3]
target = 12 profit's target
